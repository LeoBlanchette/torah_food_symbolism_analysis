# Torah / Biblical Food Symbolisms and Their Meanings

> Proverbs 23:7: For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he...

I will write a quick summary here, but it is more important to me that the scriptures speak for themselves as they stand in side-by-side comparisons. I will only speak as to how they are connected.

### Summary

Symbolically, **food is doctrine, doctrine is food.** This is an important key in the scriptures that will open up entirely new threads of meaning to you from the scriptures which were formerly hidden in parables.

By understanding the food symbolisms, new and important meanings open up in the salvation story, the interpretation of texts, and even understanding the nature and identity of the Wild Beast (a figure of Satan and his kingdom) found throughout the scriptures.

### The Beasts of the Earth are Types of People

Above, we see that Barnabas gives us some very easy interpretations of people types represented by animals under inspiration. 

The greatest introduction of the human race being symbolized by animals is found in the [Book of Enoch](https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases_deuterocanonical/blob/master/sources/en/1-enoch/1-enoch.md). This book provides important symbolisms concerning the various nations and the animals that represent them. 

This is found in 85:1 - 90:42. 

The various animals mentioned in this parable can be intuitively connected to the nations as we recognize the events that transpired in biblical history. 

- Sheep
- Wolves
- Lions
- Eagles
- Falcons
- Vultures
- Dogs
- Foxes
- Wild Boars
- Hyenas
- Crows
- Kites
- Ravens
- Hawks
- Men / Shepherds (which are angels, in this parable)

Take note of some important facts in this parable of the sheep:

The first patriarchs/matriarchs are bulls and heifers. The first of the sheep was Jacob. Jacob's brother was a pig.

We already know from Barnabas what the significance of these animals is. Test the symbols in your own reasoning and see if they add up. Esau was certainly a pig, Jacob was indeed the first sheep, and the first fathers were exemplary in the strength of their faith, making them bulls. (Note that Jacob's years were significantly less than his father's, as he stated, showing the transformation of types.)

Of extreme importance to us in this parable is the occasional transformation of a MAN to a BEAST, or a BEAST to a MAN. Or, relatively speaking, An Angel to a Man, or a Man to an Angel. 

Why is this important? Because we must seek to be elevated above the nature of a beast and be rescued from this curse, as Enoch and Elijah were in this parable.


## Reaffirming the Food / Doctrine Interchangeability

The principle confirmed in Mathew:

> Matthew 16:11-12: 11 How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees? 12 Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the **doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees**.

Presented in Enoch:

> Enoch 82:2-3 I have given Wisdom to thee and to thy children, And thy children that shall be to thee, That they may give it to their children for generations, This wisdom (namely) that passeth their thought. And those who understand it shall not sleep, But shall listen with the ear that they may learn this wisdom, And it shall please those that eat thereof **better than good food**.

The **Word-is-Food** emphasized in John:

> John 6:54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.

But spiritually applied in the prophets:

> Jeremiah 15:16 Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.

## You Are What You Eat: Human Thoughts, Connections, and Associations

It is not Jesus alone who is food (He being THE Lamb), but also the many people typified as beasts (ravens, kites, dogs, etc).

If you associate with evil beasts (people), you become like them. You devour their words, ingest their nature, and become like them.

Once again, this is explained in Barnabas:

> Barnabas 10:10 [10:10] And David receiveth knowledge concerning the same **three doctrines**, and saith in like manner, Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, even as the fish walk in darkness into the depths of the sea, and hath not stood in the way of sinners, even as they who pretend to fear the Lord sin as doth the swine, and hath not sat in the seat of the destroyers, even as the birds that sit for prey. Ye have also in the end a commandment concerning food;

## The Deeper Food Parables: Proverbs and Daniel 

Now for longer passages. These introduce a setting of EATING, but end with a result of KNOWLEDGE. Whether bad or good. 

While it is vitally important that I be brief, these passages must be seen in their fuller context. Take note of how the narration drifts between food, doctrine, and action as though they were the same. 

Let us do **Proverbs 23** first:

### Proverbs 23:

> 1 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee: 
>
> 2 And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.
>
> 3 Be not desirous of his dainties: **for they are deceitful meat**.
> 
> 4 Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.
> 
> 5 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.
> 
> 6 **Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye**, neither desire thou his dainty meats:
> 
> 7 For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.
> 
> 8 **The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and LOSE THY SWEET WORDS**.

Here we see a presentation of EATING, but with the result of WORDS. 

This is not a literal setting of one eating with a king, but rather akin to:

> 1 Corinthians 10:21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be **partakers of the Lord's table**, and of the **table of devils**.

You can read the remainder of Proverbs 23 to find that the comparison between the **two tables** is mentioned in a variety of ways.

### Daniel 1:

> 8 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not **defile himself with the portion of the king's meat**, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
> 
> 9 Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.
> 
> 10 And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your **meat and your drink**: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.
> 
> 11 Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
> 
> 12 Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.
> 
> 13 Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.
> 
> 14 So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
> 
> 15 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.
> 
> 16 **Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.**
> 
> 17 As for these four children, **God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.**
> 
> 18 Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
> 
> 19 And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.
> 
> 20 **And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.**

So we see the situation is similar to that of Proverbs: The boys sat down with the king at his table. Yet, by not eating his food (his counsels) and rather choosing the table of God (His counsels), they were wiser.

For those who insist on literal meanings and food laws, I emphasize context: On one hand, the story speaks of food, but ends with knowledge (the same pattern as the account in Proverbs), emphasizing the whole parable.

This is of huge importance in the context of Babylon because, as the book of Enoch and Jubilees teaches us, Babylon inherited all of the teachings of the Watchers, the first of the major profane and unclean doctrines that corrupted people who learned them. 

> Enoch 69:11 For men were created exactly like the angels, to the intent that they should continue pure and righteous, and death, which destroys everything, could not have taken hold of them, **but through this their knowledge they are perishing**, and through this power it is consuming me. 

## A Summary of Main Parts

The main scripture study has been presented. Please be sure to read the Epistle of Barnabas. It was accepted by the ancient Christians and does not contain any false doctrine. It is inspired.

It has been clearly shown that the scriptures consistently use food as it pertains to doctrine and growth toward God (or, conversely, growth toward the devil).

If you wish to see more application of the thought, I will paraphrase and explain more below.

### Applications of the Points, and Manner of Reasoning

A simple key is given in the scriptures that the heart and tongue are closely related in symbol:

> Proverbs 23:7: For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he...

Also:

> Matthew 12:34 O generation of **vipers**, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the **heart** the mouth speaketh.

Notice again, the animal (viper) is identified by the heart, which is revealed by the tongue. 

#### The Wild Beast

Remember this statement above? 

> we must seek to be elevated above the nature of a beast and be rescued from this curse, as Enoch and Elijah were in this parable.

Like it or not, the default state of the human race is a beast, though Genesis does stipulate that God created domestic and wild animals distinctly different. But the truth still holds:

> Ecclesiastes 3:19 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast...

And yet we find in the same chapter that there is a difference to be found: 

> Who knoweth the **spirit of man that goeth upward**, and the spirit of the **beast that goeth downward** to the earth?

Ultimately the beast goes to hell, the man eventually goes to heaven. 

This is shown in Psalms: 

> Psalm 49:20 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.

This is confirmed in the Story of the Rich Man and Lazarus, where the rich man (in honor) goes to hell. Lazarus goes to heaven. So the rich man is the beast, and lazarus is the man. 

This same example can be recalled in the former Proverbs example: **Labor not to be rich.**

Which loops us back to the very same symbolism in Job concerning evil doctrine, food, and a bad outcome for a serpentine man:

**Job 20:12-17:**

> 12 **Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth**, though he hide it under his tongue;
> 
> 13 Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:
> 
> 14 **Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him**.
>
> 15 **He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.**
> 
> 16 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.
>
> 17 He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.

To put it simply, the identity of the **Wild Beast** is largely known through the pursuit of riches by evil means. And really, simply stated, the pursuit of riches. (Matthew 6:24)

And the wrath of God is poured out upon such people.

**This is why the power of the Wild Beast is enforced through buying and selling. (Revelation 13)**

## The Final Application 

Doctrine, being types of food in symbol, results in knowledge (good or bad). The pattern is the same concerning Adam and Eve, with the **Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil**. They ate and gained knowledge. So the tree was doctrine of a sort.

While the food laws of the Torah can be understood through literal means, carnally, the better goal is to understand their meaning, and to avoid the counsels and people that the unclean foods represent, and seek out the counsels and the people that the clean foods represent.
